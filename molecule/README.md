# Molecule Testing

This role supports [Molecule](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/molecule/), an Ansible testing framework designed for developing and testing Ansible collections, playbooks, and roles.

## Prerequisites

To utilize Molecule you need to prepare several requirements:

- **x86** computer running one of these operating systems that make use of [systemd](https://systemd.io/):
  - **Archlinux**
  - **CentOS**, **Rocky Linux**, **AlmaLinux**, or possibly other RHEL alternatives (although your mileage may vary)
  - **Debian** (10/Buster or newer)
  - **Ubuntu** (18.04 or newer, although [20.04 may be problematic](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/ansible.md#supported-ansible-versions) if you run the Ansible playbook on it)
- `root` access on the computer which Molecule runs against
- [Ansible](http://ansible.com/) program
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - Most distributions install Python by default, but some don't (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04) and require manual installation (something like `apt-get install python3`)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
  - Access to Docker UNIX socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is required by default

## Installation

To set up the environment for using Molecule, run the command below on the terminal:

```bash
python3 -m venv ./molecule/venv
source ./molecule/venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r ./molecule/requirements.txt
```

## Scenarios

Currently there is one testing scenario available.

### `default`

Tests a standard VersaTiles installation, serving a small pre-built `.versatiles` container (the Dresden area, about 19 MB) that is downloaded the same way the role downloads one on a real host.

Besides the systemd service being active, it asserts that:

- the bundled front-end is served at `/`
- `/tiles/index.json` lists the `osm` tile source, which only appears if the data directory really is bind-mounted and named in the systemd unit
- a tile fetched from `/tiles/osm/0/0/0` is a real Mapbox Vector Tile (a protobuf carrying a `shortbread` layer), rather than merely a 200 response
- the timezone from `templates/env.j2` is present in the running process's environment
- the Traefik labels from `templates/labels.j2` are attached to the container
- the version the running binary reports is the one `versatiles_version` asks for

The last point is why a Renovate version bump is allowed to merge itself: a bump to a version whose front-end image is missing or broken cannot pass this scenario.

A VersaTiles instance with no tile source at all still answers `/` with 200 and serves the whole front-end, so none of the tile assertions may be reduced to a status-code check.

## Running

By default it is configured to run the scenarios on Ubuntu 26.04.

```bash
molecule test --scenario-name default
```

You can utilize other distributions by setting one to the `MOLECULE_DISTRO` environment variable:

```bash
# Ubuntu 24.04
MOLECULE_DISTRO=ubuntu2404 molecule test --scenario-name default

# Debian 13
MOLECULE_DISTRO=debian13 molecule test --scenario-name default

# Debian 12
MOLECULE_DISTRO=debian12 molecule test --scenario-name default
```
